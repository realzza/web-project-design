    <h1>CSS Transitions & Animations</h1>
    <p>
      The transition properties in CSS allow you to change property values
      smoothly over a given duration. They are generally used in combination
      with psuedo-classes like
      <code>:hover</code> and <code>:active</code> or <code>:focus</code>, which
      specify rules based on user interaction with page elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transitions and animations can be a good way to provide feedback to a user
      about clickable content or focus attention.

      provides one of the most exhaustive intros to CSS animation. Check out the
      stylesheet referenced in this document for css code and more links.

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <div class="transition-grow"><p>Hover me to see a transition.</p></div>
    <div class="transformation"><p>There are also transformations</p></div>
    <p>
      There are also animations properties, which are a bit more complicated.
      Just remember they take two steps. First, you need to specify an
      <code>@keyframes ____ {}</code> rule with a name and the property values
      to animate in their starting states or ending states. And then that name
      is used to bind an animation to an element or psuedo-class.
    </p>
    <div class="animated">I'm an animated div.</div>
    <p>
      Usually, the animation will only play once, unless you specify an
      <code>animation-iteration-count:</code>. You can set this to a numerical
      value or "infinite".
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also set the <code>@keyframes {}</code> to follow a series of
      steps instead of just an initial state and end state. You can specify
      these steps in percentage. Like below.
    </p>
    <div class="many-keyframes"><p>I'm a div with many keyframe steps.</p></div>
    <p>
      But what's an example you'd actually use? Check out the paragraph below
      where text slides in.
    </p>
    <div class="slider-container">
      <p class="slider">
        I'm gonna slide on into this browser window over and over.
      </p>
    </div>
